# Contributing

If you want to report an error or suggest an enhancement, feel free to create an issue. So we can discuss about whatever the topic is.

Creating pull requests is encouraged if an issue is related to it. If not, create a issue about the change first.

By the way, remember that everyone is free to contribute, but with responsability and humility. So be respectful with other contributors and their work.
